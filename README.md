# learning-prolog
Currently learning prolog in my programming languages class. This is a collection of the assignments we do including my changes/additions!
## Clue
Who killed Mr. Boddy??? Run `killer(boddy,X).` for a list of suspects.
## Sudoku
Equipped to solve a 4x4 sudoku board when given a valid board setup (valid meaning there is only one solution, however, it will still work if there is more than one solution to your puzzle).
